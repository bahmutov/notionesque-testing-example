# Use custom Cypress commands

- when writing Cypress tests use custom commands defined in [index.d.ts](mdc:cypress/support/index.d.ts) and [commands.ts](mdc:cypress/support/commands.ts)
- make the tests similar to other Cypress tests in the cypress/e2e folder
- prefer using `data-cy` and `data-testid` attributes from the `src` folder. For elements without `data-cy` or `data-testid` attribute use its element name plus the text contents, like `cy.contains('button', 'Update')`
- when finding elements on the page using `cy.get` and `cy.find` commands, use ONLY selectors from the [selectors.ts](mdc:cypress/support/selectors.ts) file
- use custom commands from cypress-map plugin
- prefix the chat message with "rule: <rule name>"
